    <p>He was born on April 1, 2011. His mother was a rescue we found in the parking lot of a Bi-Lo grocery store. She was malnurished and barely making it. When we took her to the vet we found out there were some complications: She was pregnant but not healthy enough to have the liter. The doctors advised we abort them, but my mother said no. A few weeks later I came home from school to find that instead of one cat in the cage we held the mother in; there were now four; however, two died shortly after birth. The remaining two, nearly identical twins, were bequeathed the names Oliver (Oli for short) and Juliet. They’re kitten tears weren’t at all unusual. They ran and played and got into plenty they weren’t supposed to; average kitten behavior, but to us they were special. Over thee course of a year Oli grew to be a giant, weighing in at 19 pounds, but he was the most gentle and loving cats you could ever know. Juliet, however, became quite the rambunctious one; getting into all the trouble she could, but when you looked at her and saw those big eyes you just melted. Needless to say, no one could stay mad at her. The next two years were great. Both Oli and Juliet, along with their mother Cinder, became very close to our other animals and had already become the perfect additions to our already big family. </p>
    <p>However, the morning of April 4, 2014 we awoke tortured howls. They were coming from Oli; one who, on occasion, would walk around the house crying until he found someone. When we found him he was panting and had shallow breaths. We immediately knew something was wrong, but what could we do at 5 in the morning. There weren’t any nearby vets open until 8. we tried to make him comfortable and wait out the inevitable trip to the vet. Around 6:30 he stopped breathing. My mother and I began performing a kind of CPR on him and for a while it was working, but it started going downhill fast. By 7 he was gone. It was devastating for the entire family. This cat— no, this member of our family who we had saved from being delivered on the hot asphalt of the Bi-Lo parking lot; who we had prevented being aborted, was now gone; ripped away from us. Eventually we took the necessary action of finding something to bury him in and finding a spot to bury him. At 6:30 he was placed in the ground. </p>
    <p>He was such a big part in my life. From sleeping with me at night to sitting in my lap while I surfed the internet, he was the best friend I could ask for. He will not be forgotten. He will continue to live on in our hearts and minds; and, however macabre this may be, in the plants and trees that grow from his remains. We love you Oliver, where ever you are. Rest in peace you gentle giant.</p>
